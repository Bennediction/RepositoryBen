        <context>The following letter was introduced in Wilde's libel trial by sir Edward Clark, Wilde's attorney. Although the letter lends support to the defense case, Clark chose to introduce the letter to prevent the defense from introducing the letter in a more dramatic fashion during its case.</context>

        <greeting>My Own Boy,</greeting>
        <line n="1">Your sonnet is quite lovely, and it is a marvel that those red-roseleaf lips of yours should be made no less</line> 
        <line n="2">for the madness of music and song than for the madness of kissing. Your slim gilt soul walks between</line>
        <line n="3" allusion ="Greek Mythology">passion and poetry. I know Hyacinthus, whom Apollo loved so madly, was you in Greek days. Why are you </line>
        <line n="4">alone in London, and when do you go to Salisbury? Do go there to cool your hands in the grey twilight of</line>
        <line n="5">Gothic things, and come here whenever you like. It is a lovely place and lacks only you; but go to Salisbury</line>
        <line n="6">first.</line>

        <greeting>Dearest of All Boys,</greeting>
        <line n="1">Your letter was delightful, red and yellow wine to me; but I am sad and out of sorts. Bosie, you must not </line>
        <line n="2">make scenes with me. They kill me, they wreck the loveliness of life. I cannot see you, so Greek and </line>
        <line n="3">gracious, distorted with passion. I cannot listen to your curved lips saying hideous things to me. I would </line>
        <line n="4">sooner be blackmailed by every renter ["renter"was a slang term for male prostitutes] in London than to have </line>
        <line n="5">you bitter, unjust, hating.You are the divine thing I want, the thing of grace and beauty; but I don't know how </line>
        <line n="6">to do it.Shall I come to Salisbury? My bill here is 49 pounds for a week. I have also got a new sitting-room </line>
        <line n="7">over the Thames. Why are you not here, my dear, my wonderful boy? I fear I must leave; no money, no credit, </line>
        <line n="8">and a heart of lead.</line>
